# Assignment 4
## Anna Lane


I visited the MTV website from 1996.  There were many basic links instead of what we now see as "buttons".  I was mostly amused by the lack of flashing fancy advertisements.

I found the GIT desktop easy to use and I am pretty sure you did a great job of explaining how and why to use it.  Did I understand you?  This assignment should be proof!
