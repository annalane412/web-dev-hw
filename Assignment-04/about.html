      <pre>
Charles was born January, 1832 in Cheshire, England. He became internationally known as an author who, in modern times, has become both loved and hated.
He was a life-long bachelor and very close to his family.  He had a “way” with children and was noted to have a special charm in relating and talking to them.
The controversy today is whether or not “Lewis Carroll” was a predator/pedophile or simply a man with a creative mind and a love for children.

<p>Interesting to make note: The word “paedophilia” did not exist in the English language during Carroll’s lifetime.
It was a word that was used after 1903, five years aft his death.<p>
During the Victorian age, children were seen as the essence of innocence.
Photos or paintings of children in any natural state were common.
Carroll received parents’ permission to photograph the “famous” picture of a 6-year-old Alice Liddell.

There is a lot to learn and to question and to wonder about the man who created Alice’s wonderland.
Most of which will always remain a mystery to us.  What a trip!

“Lewis Carroll” was made famous mostly from Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865) and its sequel,
Through the Looking-Glass (1871).
