<h1> Excerps From: The Book of Laughter and Forgetting, by Milan Kundera. </h1>

<h3>
  “Laughter? Do people even care about laughter? I mean real laughter, beyond joking, mockery, ridicule. Laughter, an immense and delicious sensual pleasure, wholly sensual pleasure. . ."
</h3>

  <p>“I said to my sister, or she said to me, come over, and shall we play laughter? We stretched out side by side on a bed and began. By pretending, of course. Forced laughter. Laughable laughter. Laughter so laughable it made us laugh. Then it came, real laughter, total laughter, taking us into its immense tide. Bursts of repeated, rushing, unleashed laughter, magnificent laughter, sumptuous and mad. . . . And we laugh out laughter to the infinity of laughter. . . . O laughter! Laughter of sensual pleasure, sensual pleasure of laughter; to laugh is to live profoundly.”</p>
