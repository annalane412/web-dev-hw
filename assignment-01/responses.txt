The internet is a network of networks built by computers and servers connecting all over the world.  I like to think of The Net as more of the "hardware" if The Web is the "software".  The Net is connecting devices and people while The Web is connecting information and data. The Web, the world wide web, is a way for people to access and share information via the internet.

The internet is created by physical connections through wires (although I beleive satellites also contribute in today's world).  Fiber-optic cables use light waves to send information.  Servers are computers dedicated to connecting other computers together in a network or to the internet. Web servers are always connected to the internet. Routers connect individual devices to the internet and to other networks. Routers also direct packets of information to where they are meant to go.  When sending or receiving information via the internet, the information is broken down in to smaller parts and then lego-ed back together when they arrive at their final destination. Wireless signals are sent as an invisible wave and are received by an antenna attached to a device that is physically connected to the internet.

A file contains information but a folder can contain files as well as other folders. A directory is a term used in web development to refer to a folder within a system.  There are paths through a "pile" of directories to locate a single file. Directories can have children and even great-grandchildren but the poor files are lonely for life.

Using a VCS, or version control system, can be beneficial in many ways.  A web developer can access older versions of the code at any time as they make changes or continue to add elements.  This allows for a developer to go back to an older version for clarification or to be able to make changes without fear of mistakes. Personally, I usually have several versions of a paper I am writing saved to my desktop so that I can go back and review... and it can be exhausting.  This method makes perfect sense especially when dealing with code!
