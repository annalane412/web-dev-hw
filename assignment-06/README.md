1. Forms are everywhere on the internet. From product registration to filing my taxes they can get pretty complicated and extensive!  The most intricate I can think of are multiple pages that can be filled out over time and your progress can be saved in order to be able to return to them later.

2. An example of text input could be for user name and password.
Selection input could be used for surveys (data collection) or multiple choice questions on a test.
Button input could be used for a "chose your own ending" or when selecting the different options for a used car purchase or blue book evaluation.

3. I found this to be our most difficult assignment so far. This makes sense as we are building on knowledge that has already been demonstrated but also that is new and more intricate.  I used the table generator that you provided us with and it was kind of fun to pay with.  I am still pretty confused on a lot of the form elements and which attributes can be used for different types of input.  All together, I found your Vimeo to be absolutely essential to this week's assignment and I am enjoying the layout of the text book.  Sometimes I find the website instructions to be unclear and missing connectivity, but the book is able to supplement that quite well.  I am trying to find time in my schedule to put more emphasis on this class so that I can start being more creative with my assignments.

4. Have a great week and enjoy this weather... might be the last of it all year! :)
