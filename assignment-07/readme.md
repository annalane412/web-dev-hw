1. The ID attribute is a way to uniquely identify different elements on a page while class attributes can label multiple elements with similar features.  The divs element creates structure within a page without adding style or format elements.  This divides the contents for organization.  Spans organize content within a <div> or a <p> element to create a unique visual style for that span.

2."alt text" refers to words that are used for the visually impaired.  If the user is unable to see an image the alt text is "read" by the users program to provide an idea of what the image would be.

3. I have been having a lot of difficulty keeping up with all of my classes this semester and I am afraid that this class has been the one to suffer the most.  I found this assignment to be really straightforward but the on-line reading to be confusing.  I couldn't figure out the video poster even though I retyped my code twice and I found that to be really frustrating.  I am hoping to finalize assignment 8 by tomorrow and am really looking forward to moving on to CSS.
