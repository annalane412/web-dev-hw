I can't seem to manage my time properly.  HTML is fun, both easy and hard and I really appreciate the book you assigned this semester.

I am looking forward to CSS just to expand my knowledge of any coding language.  At this point I am so overwhelmed I don't know if I am "excited" about anything.

I don't know why I thought that all of your deadlines were "soft".  At some point I thought I had read something saying "suggested deadlines", and not official.

I spent way too much time on the content of this page.  I got a little to enthusiastic about killing two birds... I have needed to fix that lamp forever.

Anyway, looking forward to the rest of the semester and I hope you understand that I have every intention of completing the course work by finals week.

I experienced my first file naming problem.  My phone photos are imported as .JPG instead of .jpg.  When I was reviewing my pages in Chrome by opening the files without uploading them to GitHub, the images showed up just fine.  It wasn't until I started uploading (committing) that I started to see broken image tags.
