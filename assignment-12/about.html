  by The Aggregate Kid

  i am unable to
  go on as far
  as i see him he
  is my love i ask you god
  to give it’s ours to learn
  have you still
  like me after how i
  thought about
  these little things. but most of
  all, you
  understand it’s
  almost like playing a game. you
  talk and talk. but there is no
  tomorrow; the hummingbirds
  hum their tunes to take myself to
  sleep dreaming of my mountain.

  i think that this
  childhood is without hunger, pain,
  and without
  weapons. children have a life
  you do
  i’ve been mean to him
  something mystical
  he chases me through all
  this
  links, now im dry, so im
  gonna get booted they call that
  lovely
  ship the
  unsinkable, everyone belived it
  to,the bueteyful rooms and
  elegent dining
  areas, it was the end. as
  the world my secret, i just
  wanna say just in case i
  don’t
  notice. i don’t know when you’re bummed
  out about something friends
  aren’t the
  people grow, the
  earth has
  animals, and they
  talked.
