Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?

A universal selector type is indicated with an asterisk and selects everything within the page to adhere to that piece of code.

An element does not have an indicator but is simply identified by the same name as the element itself, examples would be h1 or img.

a class adheres code to a specific div or to all divs on the page, you can add additional styling code to a class by adding an id.  adding the id selector allows you to keep the styling code from other named divs but to add adjustments to divs given a specific id

Briefly discuss your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, rgb values, or hex codes.

My primary color palette was focused on jewel tones, but I did not like the assigned RGB values to amethyst and emerald green... they weren't the colors I remember from the 90s.  However, citrine yellow seemed spot on.  So, I used the color picker as well as choosing my own 90s jewel Tones.

my primary colors were:

citrine yellow #e4d00a (which replaced my original #ffd700 gold)

teal #008080

#8B008B color picker purple

i had fun playing around with colors and looking at old photos from the nineties... so I also included:

#CC3399 color picker - I will call rose-quartz

#C5B358 Vegas gold

â€Ž#0F52BA sapphire blue
  that I used to replace border-color: #0039E6 color picker blue, when I realized what name to call it :)

Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment

this was a fun assignment!  Sometimes I find it easy to get caught up in the "project" element of these assignments and forget to put as much time in to actually learning the styling.  I think I am having a hard time understanding all of the parts of CSS but I am so much of a "hands on" learner, I am not afraid to move forward as I think experimenting and manipulating the next few assignments is really going to help me out.

Thanks for giving me extra time, I will be working hard to learn and design for these next tenish days. ~Anna
